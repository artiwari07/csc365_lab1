Lab 1 Writeup

Team Members: CSC 365-13 Arni Tiwari and CSC 365-15 Adya Choudhary

Implementation: We chose python as our programming language as we were both most comfortable with python. 
We decided to keep the students information from list.txt in a list of dictionaries to ease the process of searching. 
The keys in the dictionaries were last_name for student last name, first_name for student first name, grade for student grade, classroom for the classroom, bus for bus route, gpa for gpa, teacher_last for teacher last name and teacher_first for teacher first name.
We decided to store the teachers information from teachers.txt in a list of dictionaries as well.
The keys in the dictionaries were last_name for teacher last name, first_name for teacher first name and classroom for the classroom each teacher teaches.
