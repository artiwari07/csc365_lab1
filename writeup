Lab 1 Writeup

Team Members: CSC 365-13 Arni Tiwari and CSC 365-15 Adya Choudhary

Implementation: We chose python as our programming language as we were both most comfortable with python. 
We decided to keep the students information from list.txt in a list of dictionaries to ease the process of searching. 
The keys in the dictionaries were last_name for student last name, first_name for student first name, grade for student grade, classroom for the classroom, bus for bus route, gpa for gpa, teacher_last for teacher last name and teacher_first for teacher first name.
We decided to store the teachers information from teachers.txt in a list of dictionaries as well.
The keys in the dictionaries were last_name for teacher last name, first_name for teacher first name and classroom for the classroom each teacher teaches.
For the new requirements we decided to take command line instructions as follows:
NR1 - Given a classroom number, list all students assigned to it SC: <number>
NR2 - Given a classroom number, find the teacher (or teachers) teaching TC: <number>
NR3 - Given a grade, find all teachers who teach it TG: <number>
NR4 - 
NR 5 -

Task Log:

This took approximately a 2 hours

Adya Choudhary:
Wrote code to fulfill R8-R13 of the assignment. 

This took approximately 1.5 hours. 

Testing:
Arni did manual testing functions NR1-NR3 of the assignment to verify the correct output and handle invalid inputs. Also retested functions of lab 1-a fulfilling requirements R4-R9. This took approximately 1 hour

Adya did testing for functions fulfilling R4-R11 of the assignment. 

Bugs that were fixed:
