Lab 1 Writeup

Team Members: CSC 365-13 Arni Tiwari and CSC 365-15 Adya Choudhary

Implementation: We chose python as our programming language as we were both most comfortable with python. 
We decided to store the students in a list of dictionaries to ease the process of searching. 
The keys in the deictionaries were last_name for student last name, first_name for student first name, grade for student grade, classroom for the classroom, bus for bus route, gpa for gpa, teacher_last for teacher last name and teacher_first for teacher first name.

Task Log:
Arni Tiwari:
Wrote function to parse test file
Wrote function to search students by last name, students by last name and bus option, search students by teacher last name and output students with the same grade.

This took approximately 2 hours

Adya Choudhary:
Wrote code to fulfill R8-R13 of the assignment. 

This took approximately 1.5 hours. 

Testing:
Arni did some preliminary manual testing and checked that the text file was being parsed correctly and the functions she wrote were giving the correct output and handling invalid inputs.

Adya did testing for functions fulfilling R4-R11 of the assignment. 

Bugs that were fixed:
Index out of range error for parsing the text file
NameError for some functions
